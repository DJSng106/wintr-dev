          <summary><h2>this website (2024 - present)</h2></summary>
          <p>
            Everyone has their own reason to have a website. And my reason is because I wanted a
            small piece of the internet where I can keep my online adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always love to read other websites and to get lost,
            <em>everyone</em> has something interesting to share online, and what is a better place
            than a website where you have control over.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel nostalgic and jealous about people who got to explore the internet before it was
            more commercial. Hopefully more people will make websites like it was in the good old
            days.

          <summary><h2>My youtube (2016-2018, 2021)</h2></summary>
          <p>
            I uploaded my first YouTube video in 2016 that was a screen recording of a Roblox game
            (<span class="emphasis-1"
              >and by “screen recording” I mean I pointed a camera at my screen</span
            >). Apparently, I also did 103(!) livestreams in 2018,
            <span class="emphasis-2">none of which I remember</span>. The nice benefit of that is I
            now have a small archive of what I did with my free time in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis-2">Anyway cringe aside</span>, my favourite project by far was a
            series I made called <span class="emphasis-1">[friend's name] being [adjective]</span>.
            The concept was simple: compilations of funny clips with my friends from roblox and
            discord, sometimes with added edits or jokes. I was heavily inspired by
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SovietWomble">SovietWomble</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all the online projects I’ve worked on, this is the project I look back at most
            <span class="emphasis-2">fondly</span>. It wasn’t just fun to collect and edit the
            clips, although I do have about 1,500 of them (<span class="emphasis-1"
              >with 800 still unorganized, please send help</span
            >), it was also <span class="emphasis-2">a love letter to the friendships</span> I had
            at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely want to do this again some time with other people. To me, it feels like a
            digital time capsule of the
            <span class="emphasis-1">in-jokes</span>, <span class="emphasis-2">chaos</span>, and
            <span class="emphasis-1">joy</span> we shared.

          <p>
            If you aren’t familiar with roblox aviation, you basically go on a flight just like you
            would in real life, there are passengers and crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Belgium air (later renamed to Aeroute) was a roblox aviation airline I owned. It was
            started by me and a couple of friends, these were some good times, we really had a
            community feeling even though we only had 20 members.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped it because I had other priorities at that time. I do sometimes look back at
            that time and wonder how it would have been if it didn’t stop

            what happens when you're a kid and you have too much time to spend together with your
            friend because it's summer break? <s>Building a rocket or fighting a mummy</s>, making a
            magazine of course!
          </p>
          <p>
            we got bored, decided to take some pictures around the house and then made a, and I
            quote, a "<em>girl magazine for all girls</em>". To make it funnier this was long before
            I knew I was trans.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0em">It had amazing articles like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “do you have an irritating girl in the house?” and of course a Interview with the mom
              of the irritating girl
            </li>
            <li>
              a fictional hatchimal ad (<em>because those were popular back then</em>) which in the
              ad now only costs 1000€ thanks to a 50% discount
            </li>
            <li>and the main article, 3 girls fighting the (fictional) disease of 'firosyde'</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As far as I can remember we made 2 editions but sadly I don’t have any backups of the
            original digital documents so I only have one printed version my dad printed for me.
            There was a returning motif, if something ended on a bad note the last words would be
            “this is really olala” or “I hate it”, if it would end on a good note the last words
            would be “i love it”

              [Imagine a picture of a girl here] <br />
              This girl is very irritating, the mother of this child is very angry she wants to send
              her child to daycare but that costs €515 a day so she can't and then she has much
              worse news she is disabled this is really olala.

            <p>
              Interview with the mom: I am really not happy with my child. This is just crazy and so
              stupid why does this even exist? I am going to save like a mother, I don't have enough
              money now but someday I will. I have already won the lottery 200 times but I still
              don’t have enough money yet.

            <summary>3 girls fighting the (fictional) disease of firosyde:</summary>
            <p>
              These children are infected with firosyde a bad disease that is very bad for children.
              We were able to take a look at the treatment of the children if you can't stand blood
              please quickly close this magazine.
            </p>
            <p>[bloodstream stock photo]</p>
            <p>
              This is what their blood looks like, you can see that they are infected with firosyde
              and if their blood doesn't improve then they will die within 2 years. Luckily they
              have a medicine and in a year we are going to take another look at how they are doing.
              we think extremely bad because it has already killed 2 million people, that medicine
              but there's chance for improvement
            </p>
            <p><em>1 year later</em></p>
            <p>
              We are back with the girls with firosyde. Things are going well. But the mother thinks
              they are dying. But they are better again. Unfortunately, she has to see the doctor
              every day. But they are better, the medicine has worked well. So cool everyone thinks,
              even us.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the surgery and medicine cost 3000! Euro a month. But they are fortunately fully
              reimbursed. That is equal to 36000! Euro, which is expensive but paid back. <br />
