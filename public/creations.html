          <p>
            Everyone has their own reason to have a website. And my reason is because I wanted a
            small piece of the internet where I can keep my online adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always love to read other websites and to get lost,
            <em>everyone</em> has something interesting to share online, and what is a better place
            than a website where you have control over.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel nostalgic and jealous about people who got to explore the internet before it was
            more commercial. Hopefully more people will make websites like it was in the good old
            days.

          <summary><h2>My youtube (2016-2018, 2021)</h2></summary>
          <p>
            I uploaded my first YouTube video in 2016 that was a screen recording of a Roblox game
            (<span class="emphasis-1"
              >and by “screen recording” I mean I pointed a camera at my screen</span
            >). Apparently, I also did 103(!) livestreams in 2018,
            <span class="emphasis-2">none of which I remember</span>. The nice benefit of that is I
            now have a small archive of what I did with my free time in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis-2">Anyway cringe aside</span>, my favourite project by far was a
            series I made called <span class="emphasis-1">[friend's name] being [adjective]</span>.
            The concept was simple: compilations of funny clips with my friends from roblox and
            discord, sometimes with added edits or jokes. I was heavily inspired by
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SovietWomble">SovietWomble</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all the online projects I’ve worked on, this is the project I look back at most
            <span class="emphasis-2">fondly</span>. It wasn’t just fun to collect and edit the
            clips, although I do have about 1,500 of them (<span class="emphasis-1"
              >with 800 still unorganized, please send help</span
            >), it was also <span class="emphasis-2">a love letter to the friendships</span> I had
            at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely want to do this again some time with other people. To me, it feels like a
            digital time capsule of the
            <span class="emphasis-1">in-jokes</span>, <span class="emphasis-2">chaos</span>, and
            <span class="emphasis-1">joy</span> we shared.

          <p>
            If you aren’t familiar with roblox aviation, you basically go on a flight just like you
            would in real life, there are passengers and crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Belgium air (later renamed to Aeroute) was a roblox aviation airline I owned. It was
            started by me and a couple of friends, these were some good times, we really had a
            community feeling even though we only had 20 members.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stopped it because I had other priorities at that time. I do sometimes look back at
            that time and wonder how it would have been if it didn’t stop
          </p>
